#MolNetwork

####A tool to genereate a molecular networks

###Overview:
This is a command line python tool for generating molecular networks. At the moment this is accomplished using Morgan (circular) feature counts with a radius of 4 bonds. These fingerprints are generated for each input molecule and then pairwise Dice similarity scores are caclulated for all compounds. Those scores which are above the specified cutoff are included as edges in a resulting tab deliminated output edge list file. This can be easily loaded into network visualization software such as [cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org/) or [gephi](https://gephi.org/).

####Dependencies:
* Written for python 3.5 (it's time to move on all you 2.7 users...)
* [RDKit](http://www.rdkit.org/)

  This can be a bit of a pain to install from source. Highly reccommend using the [Annaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution and installing using the [conda recipe](http://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html).

* [progressbar2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar2)

  There are potentially some long running loops in this program so it's nice to have some idea of when they're going to finish. progressbar2 does a pretty job of it. This is a bit of luxury dependency, might get removed down the line...

###Installation:

Nothing fancy yet. Either clone it or download the files and cd into the directory.Just make sure you have the dependencies installed and it should just run like any other python script. See usage section for a few examples. 
  * if you're feeling fancy you can place the folder in your system path and make a bash or batch script to make it executable in any folder. i'll add the 1-liners at some point to here. 

###Features:

Right now things are fairly basic. This is really meant to be a way to vizualize hits from screening campaigns but can be applied to general network generation use.

* Input files can be .smi files or .sd(f) files.
  * .smi file format has lines of : `smiles<tab>name,`
  * .sd or .sdf file will be detected from the extension
    *if no name attribute is in the sd file then the index will be used as the name for the output
* Full Pairwise Similarity Scoring

  The default action is to compute all pairwise Dice scores (non-redundant and no self-loops) and output those above the default threshold score of 0.8 though each of these can be changed. 

* Threshold can be changed w/ `--thresh <x>` (x=float)
* Choose fingerprint type and scoring metric with `--fptype` and `--metric` options
  * What I think are the most robust options are currently offered. more to be added shortly.
* Any resulting singletons can be included as self loops w/ `--singletons`
* A directed network can be created using the `--directed <alpha>,<beta>` where alpha and beta are Tversky weights

  This is an under appreciated distance metric for the problem of clustering molecules. If one makes beta = 1-alpha (ie alpha=0.9,beta=0.1) one direction of comparison ( ie i-->j or j--i) will allow for a high similarity score of a substructure of the other molecule that would be peanilized in say a Tanimoto score. 
    * Because the Tversky metric is used to create the asymetric distance matrix only binary fingerprints (ie `ECFP4`) can be used.
* a Networkx gpickle file can be created w/ `--nx`
* a gexf (directly readible by Gephi) file can be created with `--gexf`
  
* Negative SAR analysis

  The chemical space around hits can be explored if the full library of compounds is known. This is accomplished by the `--negsar <full_library_file>` argument. Hits are compared to all members of the full library and any scores over the threshold are included in the edge list file. An additional text file is generated (<outfile_hitMap.txt) that is a binary map of whether a node name is a hit (1) or a non-hit (0) that is of similar chemical composition to the hits.

###Experimental Featueres:

* Pairwise sampling for psuedo clustering

  For large datasets (~ >10k molecules) generation of the fingerprints and calculating all possible scores becomes infeasible. For *m* compounds there are *m*<sup>2</sup>/2 - *m* possible comparisons using the undirected graph. By using the `--samplesize <n>` (n=int) argument you can randomly sample n compounds to compare against each compound in the infile. I'm not really sure if this is useful but it might be worth playing with.

###Future Feature Ideas:

* Multiprocessing
* Chunking to disk for large datasets
* suggestions?

###Usage:

#####Basic:
`python MolNetwork.py <infile> <outfile>`
#####With singletons included and a lowered threshold:
`python MolNetwork.py <infile> <outfile> --thresh 0.7 --singletons`
#####Negative SAR option used:
`python MolNetwork.py <infile> <outfile> --negsar <full_library_file>`
##### Help!:
`python MolNetwork.py --help`
